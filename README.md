# Installation

Clone the project and navigate to its directory in terminal or bash.

Run `npm install`

This should install the project dependencies successfully.

# Usage

Navigate to the project directory if you're not still there.

Run `npm start`

Open a browser window and type `localhost:3000` in to use the word search.

You can find, replace, and delete words.

Refreshing the page or exiting your browser won't undo your changes.

To get the original text back, quit the server with Ctrl C and run `npm start` again. Refresh your browser page.

# Testing

Run automated tests by opening a new terminal or stopping the server in terminal with Ctrl C (Windows)

Run `npm test`

You will get a quick report of tests that pass or fail in the terminal.

You may also check `test-report.html` in the root project directory for a full test report.

For a code coverage report, check project directory /coverage/icov-report/index.html or for a new one,

Run `npm run jest-coverage`
